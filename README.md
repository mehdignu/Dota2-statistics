# WvH Coding Challange

Hello :)

There are **3** task, **2** must be solved in any way. 
There is no fixed Solution or Way - you just have to explain it.

First, please fork this plunk, then develop the code in the forked repository 
and when you're done, send the URI of the forked plunker-repo to: cc@wirvonhier.de

now to the tasks:
 * style the app suitable (difficulty lvl 1)
 * expand the app to Redux (difficulty lvl 2)
 * surprise me. seriously, coding something unexpected/creative - but: i'm _not easily_ to impress. :o) (difficulty lvl 10)

have fun
